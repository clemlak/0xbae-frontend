# 0xbae

## What is 0xbae?
0xbae is a (proof-of-concept) platform for online models. The goal is to offer a simple way to upload content online and get some tips in return.
*Warning: the current implementation is for demo purposes only!*

## How to use it?
Please be sure to use MetaMask (or another injected Web3 wallet) and to be connected to the Rinkeby network.
You will be able to send Rinkeby ETH to the models, and you can get some of our TESTTOKEN to mimic the SPANK and DAI tokens.
